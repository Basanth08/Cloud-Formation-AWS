# ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-Formation-AWS

Hi there! üëã I'm excited to share my hands-on journey with AWS CloudFormation. Throughout this project, I rolled up my sleeves and built, tested, and deployed a variety of templates to deepen my understanding of AWS infrastructure and DevOps best practices. Here‚Äôs a look at what I‚Äôve accomplished and how you can follow along or use these resources for your own learning!

## üöÄ My Learning Approach
I‚Äôm not just reading about AWS CloudFormation‚ÄîI‚Äôm actually using it! For every template in this repository, I:
- Designed and wrote the YAML myself
- Deployed and tested it using AWS CloudFormation
- Tweaked and improved each template based on real results

This hands-on, iterative approach has helped me truly understand how each AWS resource and feature works in practice, from launching a single EC2 instance to orchestrating a full CI/CD pipeline.

## üõ†Ô∏è Basics: CloudFormation Exercises
This section is where I got my hands dirty with the fundamentals of CloudFormation. Each exercise builds on the last, introducing new concepts and features:

- **exercise1/first-example.yaml**: I created my very first minimal EC2 instance using CloudFormation.
- **exercise2/functions.yaml**: I added tags to my EC2 instance using the `!Join` function to see how dynamic values work.
- **exercise3/update-example.yaml**: I played with updating resources by changing tags on my EC2 instance.
- **exercise4/change-set.yml**: I explored change sets by modifying the instance type and tags, learning how CloudFormation handles updates.
- **exercise5/Ref-function.yaml**: I used the `!Ref` function to reference the AWS region dynamically in my resource tags.
- **exercise6/multiResource.yaml**: I set up multiple resources‚Äîan EC2 instance and a Security Group‚Äîto understand resource relationships.
- **exercise7/MappingAndPseudo.yaml**: I experimented with mappings and pseudo parameters to select AMIs based on region.
- **exercise8/InputParameters.yaml**: I introduced parameters for things like instance type and key name, making my templates more flexible.
- **exercise9/PrintOutputs.yaml**: I learned how to print outputs from my stack, such as the public DNS of an instance.
- **exercise10/init.yaml**: I dove into advanced features like `AWS::CloudFormation::Init`, creating files and managing services for a web server.

## üîÑ CI/CD Project
After mastering the basics, I challenged myself to build a complete CI/CD stack using nested CloudFormation templates. Here‚Äôs how I broke it down:

- **cicdtemp.yaml**: I orchestrated the creation of all my CI/CD resources using nested stacks.
- **stack-template/**: I broke down the CI/CD setup into individual stack templates:
  - **app01qa.yaml**: I provisioned an application server (EC2) with Tomcat and all the necessary setup.
  - **cicds3role.yaml**: I created an IAM role and instance profile for S3 access.
  - **db01qa.yaml**: I set up a database server (EC2) with MariaDB, Memcached, RabbitMQ, and restored a database dump.
  - **jenk.yaml**: I installed and configured a Jenkins server (EC2), including importing jobs from S3.
  - **nexus.yaml**: I deployed a Nexus repository server (EC2), set up as a systemd service, and imported data from S3.
  - **sonar.yaml**: I configured a SonarQube server (EC2) with PostgreSQL and all the necessary system tweaks.
  - **wintest.yaml**: I spun up a Windows test server (EC2) with Chocolatey and Jenkins integration.

## üí° Final Thoughts
Every template in this repository is a product of my curiosity and determination to learn by doing.
